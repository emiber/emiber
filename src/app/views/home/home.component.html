<h1>Home</h1>
<p>
    Welcome to my site!
    <br>
    I'm an experienced software professional with over 20 years in the industry.
    <br>
    My journey began in 2001 as a front-end developer, crafting user interfaces and bringing designs to life with HTML,
    CSS, and JavaScript.
</p>
<p>
    As my skills grew, I transitioned into back-end development, building robust server-side applications and APIs.
    <br>
    I've worked with multiple programming languages, frameworks, and databases over the years, giving me a versatile
    technology stack.
</p>
<p>
    My passion for understanding systems deeply led me to take on architecture roles, where I designed and implemented
    scalable and maintainable software solutions.
    <br>
    have extensive experience in system analysis, solution design, and integration of complex components.
</p>
<p>
    Additionally, I've cultivated expertise in database development, skilled at data modeling, query optimization, and
    ensuring data integrity and security.
    <br>
    I've worked with both relational and NoSQL databases in various projects.
</p>
<p>
    Throughout my career, I've had the opportunity to wear many hats - from front-end to back-end, architecture to
    databases.
    <br>
    This breadth of experience has given me a holistic perspective on software development lifecycles and best
    practices.
